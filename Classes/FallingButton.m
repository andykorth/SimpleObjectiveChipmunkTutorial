		// Now we just need to initialize the instance variable for the chipmunkObjects property.

		// Notice that we didn't even have to keep a reference to 'shape'. It was created using the autorelease convenience function.
		// This means that the chipmunkObjects NSSet will manage the memory for us. No need to worry about forgetting to call
